# @elizaos/plugin-health

Health, sleep, circadian-regularity, and screen-time domain plugin for elizaOS.

## Purpose / role

Provides the health and sleep domain layer for Eliza agents — connector registrations (Apple Health, Google Fit, Strava, Fitbit, Withings, Oura), sleep/circadian/regularity inference engines, screen-time type contracts, wake/bedtime anchor contributions, `ActivitySignalBus` family declarations, and default scheduled-task packs (bedtime, wake-up, sleep-recap). Loaded as `healthPlugin` (package `@elizaos/plugin-health`). Opt-in; consumed by plugins such as `@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant`. All registry contributions are soft-dependency: if `connectorRegistry`, `anchorRegistry`, `busFamilyRegistry`, or `defaultPackRegistry` are absent on the runtime, the plugin logs a one-line skip and continues without error.

## Plugin surface

The plugin object (`healthPlugin`) registers no runtime actions, providers, or text-routing evaluators directly. Health owns the reusable action/provider/route/service surfaces (`createOwnerHealthAction`, `createOwnerScreenTimeAction`, `createHealthActionRunner`, `createScreenTimeActionRunner`, `createHealthProvider`, `createHealthSleepRouteHandler`, `createHealthSleepServiceMethods`) so host plugins inject access checks, route context, and storage/service adapters instead of duplicating health metadata. Natural owner requests stay model-owned through the host-registered `OWNER_HEALTH` action. Its `init` function calls four registration helpers:

| Registration call | What it contributes |
|---|---|
| `registerHealthConnectors(runtime)` | 6 `ConnectorContribution`s: `apple_health`, `google_fit`, `strava`, `fitbit`, `withings`, `oura` |
| `registerHealthAnchors(runtime)` | 4 `AnchorContribution`s: `wake.observed`, `wake.confirmed`, `bedtime.target`, `nap.start` |
| `registerHealthBusFamilies(runtime)` | 8 `BusFamilyContribution`s: `health.sleep.detected`, `health.sleep.ended`, `health.wake.observed`, `health.wake.confirmed`, `health.nap.detected`, `health.bedtime.imminent`, `health.regularity.changed`, `health.workout.completed` |
| `registerHealthDefaultPacks(runtime)` | 3 `DefaultPack`s: `bedtime`, `wake-up`, `sleep-recap` |

`init` also calls `registerCircadianInsightContract(runtime, createDefaultCircadianInsightContract())` to attach the `CircadianInsightContract` seam on the runtime symbol `Symbol.for("@elizaos/plugin-health:circadian-insight-contract")`.

### Key exported constants

- `HEALTH_CONNECTOR_KINDS` — tuple of the 6 connector kind strings.
- `HEALTH_ANCHORS` — tuple of the 4 anchor key strings.
- `HEALTH_BUS_FAMILIES` — tuple of the 8 bus family strings.
- `HEALTH_DEFAULT_PACKS` — array of the 3 `DefaultPack` objects.
- `HEALTH_PLUGIN_NAME` — `"plugin-health"`.

### Key exported functions / contracts

- `getCircadianInsightContract(runtime)` — resolves the registered `CircadianInsightContract` from the runtime; returns `null` if not registered.
- `registerCircadianInsightContract(runtime, contract)` — attaches an implementation.
- `createDefaultCircadianInsightContract()` — factory for the built-in implementation.
- `getHealthProviderSpec(provider)` / `setHealthProviderSpec(spec)` — read/register a `HealthProviderSpec` in the per-provider OAuth registry (the spec carries its own `provider` key).

## Config / env vars

| Env var | Read in | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ELIZA_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | `util/token-encryption.ts` | AES-256-GCM key for OAuth tokens at rest; falls back to a lazily-created `<credentialsDir>/.encryption-key` file (mode 0600) when unset. |
| `ELIZA_<PREFIX>_CLIENT_ID` / `ELIZA_<PREFIX>_CLIENT_SECRET` / `ELIZA_<PREFIX>_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `health-bridge/health-oauth.ts` | Per-provider OAuth config. `<PREFIX>` is the provider `envPrefix`: `STRAVA`, `FITBIT`, `WITHINGS`, `OURA`. |
| `ELIZA_HEALTHKIT_CLI_PATH` | `health-bridge/health-bridge.ts` | Path to the HealthKit native CLI helper (darwin). |
| `ELIZA_GOOGLE_FIT_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `health-bridge/health-bridge.ts` | Access token for the Google Fit REST fallback. |
| `ELIZA_TEST_HEALTH_BACKEND` | `health-bridge/health-bridge.ts` | Force a specific backend (test override). |
| `ELIZA_MOCK_GOOGLE_BASE` | `health-bridge/health-bridge.ts` | Loopback-only mock API base for Google Fit tests. |
| `ELIZA_MOCK_HEALTH_BASE` / `ELIZA_MOCK_<PROVIDER>_BASE` | `health-bridge/health-connectors.ts` | Loopback-only mock API bases for tests (`<PROVIDER>` upper-cased); `ELIZA_MOCK_HEALTH_BASE` is the fallback when no provider-specific override is set. |

The OAuth-dir root is resolved via `resolveOAuthDir` from `@elizaos/core`, so its own env knobs are owned upstream, not here.

## How to extend

### Add a new connector kind

1. Add the kind string to `HEALTH_CONNECTOR_KINDS` in `src/connectors/index.ts`.
2. Add entries to `HEALTH_CONNECTOR_CAPABILITIES` and `CONNECTOR_LABELS` in the same file.
3. Add a `HealthProviderSpec` entry via `setHealthProviderSpec(spec)` (the spec carries its own `provider` and `envPrefix`) in `src/health-bridge/health-provider-registry.ts` (or call it at runtime boot).
4. Wire the OAuth reader in `src/health-bridge/health-connectors.ts`.
5. Export from `src/health-bridge/index.ts` if new public helpers are added.

### Add an action surface

Action metadata and parameter ownership belongs here. If the action still needs LifeOps persistence or owner access checks, expose a factory/runner pair that accepts host adapters instead of importing `@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant`. Only add an action directly to `healthPlugin.actions` when it no longer depends on LifeOps storage or routing.

### Add a default pack

Create `src/default-packs/<name>.ts` implementing `DefaultPack`, add it to `HEALTH_DEFAULT_PACKS` in `src/default-packs/index.ts`, and export it.

## Conventions / gotchas

- **Wave-1 soft-dependency posture.** All four `register*` calls in `init` check for the registry on the runtime and log a single skip line if absent — never throw. Callers do not need to guard.
- **Action registration vs action ownership.** The `actions: []` in `healthPlugin` is still intentional for runtime registration, but action metadata and planning surfaces live here. `@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant` may register host-adapted health actions only by calling plugin-health factories.
- **No `app-lifeops` build-time dep.** `src/util/time.ts` and `src/util/time-util.ts` are local copies of same-named helpers to avoid a circular dependency. Do not replace them with imports from `app-lifeops`.
- **CircadianInsightContract is the canonical seam.** Any code that needs circadian state or scheduling-window inference resolves it via `getCircadianInsightContract(runtime)` — never deep-imports `src/sleep/*` from outside the plugin.
- **Screen-time aggregation ownership.** `src/screen-time/` owns contracts,
  taxonomy, ranges, mobile signals, summary/breakdown/history calculations, and
  HTTP query dispatch. Hosts inject activity/social/storage ports and retain
  authentication and response serialization; never recreate calculations in a host.
- **Token encryption.** `src/util/token-encryption.ts` encrypts OAuth tokens at rest using a per-runtime key; do not store raw tokens elsewhere.
- See root `CLAUDE.md` for global architecture rules, logger conventions, and ESM/naming requirements.

## Verification

Follow the repository-wide verification and evidence standard in the [root CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). Run
the package's relevant build, typecheck, lint, and test commands, then exercise
the real integration boundary changed by the work. Inspect the produced domain
artifacts and failure behavior; do not substitute mocked success for the system
under test.
