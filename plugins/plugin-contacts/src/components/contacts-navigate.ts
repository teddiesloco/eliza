/**
 * Plugin-owned navigate helpers for the Contacts surface's Call/Text handoffs.
 *
 * Contacts owns no Phone or Messages view, so it hands off intent through the
 * shared navigate-view bus: it constructs the deep-link payload the target
 * view's own `consumeNavigateViewPayload<T>()` claims on mount. The payload
 * shapes here (`{ number }` for the Phone dialer, `{ recipient }` for the
 * Messages composer) are the contract those views read; the shared core
 * (`@elizaos/ui/app-navigate-view`) stays generic and names no view id. Keeping
 * this next to the components that call it — rather than in the shared core —
 * is the point of the #12674 audit item.
