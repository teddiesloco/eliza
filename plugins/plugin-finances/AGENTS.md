# @elizaos/plugin-finances

Owner-facing finance back-end + dashboard for elizaOS: payment sources, bank /
PayPal / Plaid / CSV transactions, spending summaries, recurring-charge
detection, and email bills. Owns the finance data layer (`FinancesService` +
`FinancesRepository` over the `app_finances` schema) that
`@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant` (PA) delegates to.

## Purpose / role

Surfaces the owner's finance state — payment sources, recent transactions,
recurring charges, spending, and email bills — as a dedicated overlay app, and
provides the payments back-end the agent's OWNER_FINANCES action drives. The
plugin is opt-in; add `@elizaos/plugin-finances` to the agent's plugin list (PA
auto-registers it via `ensureLifeOpsFinancesPluginRegistered`). It hard-depends
on `@elizaos/plugin-sql` (peer dep + `dependencies: ["@elizaos/plugin-sql"]`),
and on `@elizaos/plugin-elizacloud` for the managed Plaid / PayPal clients.

## Plugin surface

**Back-end (the finance domain home)**
- `FinancesService` (`src/finances-service.ts`) — payment sources, CSV import,
  transactions, spending summaries, recurring-charge detection, email bills,
  and the Plaid / PayPal managed bridges. Standalone successor to PA's
  `withPayments` mixin; holds its own runtime + `FinancesRepository`. Throws
  `FinancesServiceError` (HTTP status) on invalid input.
- `FinancesRepository` (`src/db/finances-repository.ts`) — raw SQL over
  `app_finances` (payment sources / transactions + subscription audits /
  candidates / cancellations). Uses `src/db/sql.ts`, a finance adapter over the
  canonical Core raw-SQL boundary. PA's `LifeOpsRepository` delegates its methods
  here so the PA subscriptions mixin reaches the finance tables unchanged.
- `SubscriptionsService` (`src/services/subscriptions-service.ts`) — standalone
  successor to PA's `withSubscriptions` mixin. Handles subscription audit /
  cancellation; reaches Gmail via `SubscriptionsGmailGateway`
  (`src/services/gmail-seam.ts`) and the browser bridge via
  `SubscriptionsBrowserGateway` (`src/services/browser-bridge-seam.ts`) through
  runtime-service seams instead of PA internals.
- `runPaymentsHandler`, `MONEY_PARAMETERS`, `OWNER_FINANCE_SIMILES`,
  `MONEY_TAGS`, `MONEY_CONTEXTS` (`src/actions/finances.ts`) — the payments
  OWNER_FINANCES dispatch + parameter schema. PA imports these; the registered
  `OWNER_FINANCES` umbrella action stays in PA because it also routes
  `subscription_*` to PA's Gmail/browser-orchestrating subscription back-end.
- Normalized capability layer (`src/finance-capabilities.ts`) — provider-neutral
  pure calculations behind the `balances`, `budget_status`, `subscriptions`, and
  `anomalies` subactions. Every capability response carries
  `FinanceCapabilityMeta` (freshness + calculation method), and the internal
  writes (`add_source`, `remove_source`, `import_csv`) return a
  `FinanceWriteReceipt`. Read/derive only — nothing here initiates payments,
  transfers, or trading, and receipts never carry credentials.

**Views**
- `finances` — `FinancesView` component, path `/finances`, bundle
  `dist/views/bundle.js`. Fetches the four `/api/lifeops/money/*` GET routes
  (dashboard / sources / transactions / recurring), served by PA's route layer
  via `runFinancesRoute` → `FinancesService`. URLs + response shapes are stable.

**Schema** (`financesSchema` = `pgSchema("app_finances")`, registered via the
plugin `schema` field; the SQL plugin owns the migration runner)
- `lifePaymentSources`, `lifePaymentSourceIdentities`,
  `lifePaymentTransactions`, `lifeSubscriptionAudits`,
  `lifeSubscriptionCandidates`, `lifeSubscriptionCancellations`.
  `lifePaymentSourceIdentities` is the normalized, unique provider-connection
  claim used to serialize concurrent Link completion. The five legacy table NAMES are
  preserved verbatim from the original LifeOps tables (`life_payment_*`,
  `life_subscription_*`) so the non-destructive copy migration
  (`FinancesMigrationService`) can move existing `app_lifeops` rows across.
  Amounts are stored in USD (`amount_usd` real), not minor units.

## Boundary with plugin-personal-assistant

- `@elizaos/plugin-finances` MUST NOT import `@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant`.
- PA delegates the payments back-end here (routes via `runFinancesRoute` →
  `FinancesService`; `actions/payments.ts` re-exports `runPaymentsHandler`).
- **Subscription audit / cancellation lives in `SubscriptionsService`**
  (`src/services/subscriptions-service.ts`), a standalone successor to PA's
  `withSubscriptions` mixin. It reaches cross-domain surfaces through
  runtime-service seams (`gmail-seam.ts` via `@elizaos/plugin-google-workspace`,
  `browser-bridge-seam.ts` via `@elizaos/plugin-browser`) rather than PA
  internals, so it carries no PA dependency.

## Config / env vars

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ELIZA_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | No | 32-byte (base64/hex) key encrypting PayPal tokens at rest. Plaid Item tokens remain in organization-bound Cloud credentials; the local source stores only an opaque connection id. Falls back to a lazily-generated `<oauth-dir>/lifeops/payments/.encryption-key` (mode 0600). |
| `ELIZAOS_CLOUD_API_KEY` | No | Eliza Cloud API key for the managed Plaid / PayPal bridges. |
| `ELIZAOS_CLOUD_BASE_URL` | No | Eliza Cloud base URL override for the managed bridges. |

## What lives here vs. in PA

| Concern | Home |
|---|---|
| Payment back-end (`FinancesService`) + repository (`FinancesRepository`) | plugin-finances |
| Finance schema (`app_finances`) + migration | plugin-finances |
| Payment / subscription types, recurring detection, CSV parse, token crypto, playbooks | plugin-finances |
| `runPaymentsHandler` + OWNER_FINANCES param schema / similes | plugin-finances (`src/actions/finances.ts`) |
| Subscription audit / cancellation (`SubscriptionsService`) | plugin-finances (`src/services/subscriptions-service.ts`) |
| Registered `OWNER_FINANCES` umbrella action + `runMoneyHandler` dispatch | PA (`owner-surfaces.ts` / `money.ts`) — routes `subscription_*` to PA |
| `/api/lifeops/money/*` routes | PA (`lifeops-routes.ts`, `runFinancesRoute` → `FinancesService`) |

## How to extend

**Add a payments sub-op:**
1. Add the subaction to `PaymentsSubaction` + `MONEY_PARAMETERS` and the
   `switch` in `runPaymentsActionInner` (`src/actions/finances.ts`).
2. Add the method to `FinancesService` (`src/finances-service.ts`); add any new
   raw-SQL access to `FinancesRepository` (`src/db/finances-repository.ts`).
3. If it needs a route, add it under `/api/lifeops/money/*` in PA's
   `lifeops-routes.ts` using `runFinancesRoute`.

**Add a finance provider integration (bank / CSV / payments):**
1. Add a method to `FinancesService` (and `FinancesRepository` for persistence).
2. For OAuth/managed bridges, follow the Plaid / PayPal pattern via
   `@elizaos/plugin-elizacloud/cloud/managed-payment-clients`.

**Add a future view adapter:**
1. Build the adapter component under `src/components/finances/`.
2. Re-export it from `finances-view-bundle.ts`.
3. Add a view descriptor to the `views` array in `src/plugin.ts`.

## Conventions / gotchas

- **`@elizaos/plugin-sql` must be loaded first.** The drizzle schema is
  registered through the `schema` field; the SQL plugin owns the migration
  runner. Without it, the tables will not be created.
- **Two build steps.** The JS/types build (tsup + tsc) and the Vite views
  build are separate. The views bundle (`dist/views/bundle.js`) is what the
  `bundlePath` in the view registration points to.
- **Scoping is per-agent** (`agent_id`); the route/service derive the owner
  entity from the request context.
- **Currency amounts are stored in USD** (`amount_usd` real), not minor units.
- **No import of `@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant`.** Cross-domain capability
  the finance back-end needs (Gmail, browser bridge) is accessed via runtime-service
  seams, not PA internals.
- **`src/db/sql.ts` adapts the Core raw-SQL boundary.** Database capability
  probing, result-envelope validation, JSON parsing, scalar coercion, and SQL
  literal encoding stay canonical in `@elizaos/core`. Finance retains only its
  transaction and optimistic-concurrency semantics here.
- See the root `CLAUDE.md` for repo-wide architecture rules, logger
  requirements, ESM/module standards, and git workflow.

## Verification

Follow the repository-wide verification and evidence standard in the [root CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). Run
the package's relevant build, typecheck, lint, and test commands, then exercise
the real integration boundary changed by the work. Inspect the produced domain
artifacts and failure behavior; do not substitute mocked success for the system
under test.
