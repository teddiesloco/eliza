/**
 * Integration invariant for the LifeOps decomposition.
 *
 * After breaking the monolith into focused plugins, PA (the chief-of-staff hub)
 * is composed *with* the seven domain plugins it integrates. This test pins the
 * properties that a large decomposition silently breaks: a dropped owner action,
 * two different service classes claiming one serviceType (the runtime skips the
 * second, so it never starts), two views shadowing one id, or an affinity-map
 * action name that no loaded plugin actually registers.
 *
 * It models the runtime's real registration behavior (first-wins dedup —
 * `AgentRuntime.registerAction`/`registerService` skip a name/serviceType that
 * is already present) without booting the scheduler stack, so it is fast and
 * deterministic.
