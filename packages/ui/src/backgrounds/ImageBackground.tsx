/**
 * A full-bleed cover image for the unified app background. Centered, cover-fit,
 * no repeat — the user's uploaded or generated wallpaper sits behind the home
 * and every view that opts into the shared background.
 *
 * The image is painted under a theme-token scrim (the child layer below). A
 * photo wallpaper is ambience, not content: without the scrim a bright,
 * saturated image (the stock sunset especially) competes with the greeting,
 * cards, and composer sitting on top of it. The canonical Canopy wallpaper is
 * already graded near-black, so dark mode uses a lighter scrim for that one
 * image rather than crushing its forest detail twice. Light mode and every
 * other image retain the stronger guard needed for foreground contrast. A
 * token scrim (no blur, no per-pixel filter work) is also the cheapest possible
 * treatment: one plain composited layer, gate-safe, GPU-trivial.
 *
 * BOTTOM EDGE: the wallpaper is a `fixed inset-0` cover-fit layer. On the
 * installed iOS standalone PWA the `fixed` containing block does NOT resolve to
 * the true 932px screen — it collapses to the small ICB (`ce873` while the
 * physical screen is `sh932`, device-verified), so a bare `inset-0`
 * (`bottom: 0`) stops the wallpaper ~59px SHORT of the home-indicator edge and
 * that dead band paints as the recurring black strip. We reclaim it by dropping
 * this layer's `bottom` by the JS-MEASURED gap `--standalone-bottom-reclaim`
 * (#15036) so the wallpaper genuinely owns the whole screen down to the
 * home-indicator edge, lock-screen style. The var is a hard 0 off the
 * iOS-standalone/native surface, so this is a true no-op on desktop/web/Android.
 * No cosmetic bottom-floor gradient is needed (the prior warm-ember lift strip
 * existed only to disguise that launch-bg band); we mount ONLY the legibility
 * scrim. */
