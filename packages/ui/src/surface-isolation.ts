/**
 * Isolation-level catalogue for every shipped app surface (#13452) — the
 * durable, greppable answer to "which isolation level does each view use, and
 * why". A view renders into a shared shell tree; its {@link SurfaceIsolationLevel}
 * (declared on its surface manifest) states how far it is separated from the
 * host realm and from other views. This module documents the mapping AND is the
 * live typed source the shell/audit can read — a doc that cannot drift from the
 * code because it IS code.
 *
 * ── The four isolation levels and their per-platform embedding ──────────────
 *
 *  in-process — trusted first-party shell views run in the host DOM/React realm
 *    with the full host singleton (React, API client, native bridges). There is
 *    no sandbox: trust is the boundary. This is every built-in shell page (chat,
 *    settings, launcher pages, wallet/inventory, knowledge, logs, database, …).
 *    Web/desktop/mobile all render these in the same host webview. The manifest
 *    still scopes what they may touch (background, capabilities) even though they
 *    share the realm — isolation level and capability grants are orthogonal.
 *
 *  sandboxed-iframe — untrusted or third-party WEB views that must not share the
 *    host realm. They render in an `<iframe sandbox>` with a postMessage
 *    capability broker; MDN warns that `allow-scripts` + `allow-same-origin` on
 *    same-origin content is not a real sandbox, so the frame is served without
 *    `allow-same-origin` (opaque origin) and reaches the shell only through the
 *    broker (`navigate`/`storage`). `DynamicViewLoader` frames any view declaring
 *    this level; the `sandbox-probe` developer view is the shipped consumer.
 *
 *  native-webview — heavy or untrusted views that embed a NATIVE child
 *    web-content surface with the strongest platform renderer boundary and an
 *    explicit process/storage-sharing policy. Desktop uses an Electron/Electrobun
 *    `WebContentsView` (the successor to the deprecated `BrowserView`); iOS uses
 *    a `WKWebView` with a chosen `WKProcessPool`; Android uses an out-of-app
 *    `WebView` renderer that the OS may reuse, plus profile-backed storage.
 *    The Browser view is the canonical consumer — it hosts
 *    arbitrary third-party web content and must never share the host realm.
 *
 *  immersive — a fullscreen surface that owns its whole window and is chrome-free
 *    (launcher/home, background editor). It is in-process like the shell but is
 *    the only non-launcher level allowed to paint the shared wallpaper — and only
 *    when its manifest also grants `wallpaper` (see {@link resolveSurfaceManifest}).
 *
 * ── Mapping current view families to levels ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The table below is authored per family, not per view id, because every view
 * in a family shares a level. A view's manifest may still override its level;
 * this is the DEFAULT catalogue the shell documents. New view families should be
 * added here when they ship so the doc stays complete.
