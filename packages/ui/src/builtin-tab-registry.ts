/**
 * Declarative registry for the app's builtin (host-owned) tab surfaces.
 *
 * Historically `App.tsx` routed builtin surfaces through TWO parallel,
 * hand-maintained name-keyed enumerations that could silently drift:
 *
 *  1. `renderStaticViewRouterTab` — a `directViews` object literal plus a chain
 *     of `if (tab === "...")` branches deciding which component + wrapper each
 *     builtin tab renders (App.tsx item #34, target line ~1218).
 *  2. `builtinRouteBackgroundPolicy` — a second `if (tab === "...")` chain
 *     deciding each builtin tab's screen background policy (target line ~770).
 *
 * A tab present in one chain but absent (or aliased differently) in the other
 * was an unobservable drift bug: e.g. a builtin surface that renders fine but
 * paints the wrong background layer, or an alias honored by the router but not
 * the background resolver.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for builtin-tab METADATA: the
 * canonical id, any legacy aliases that resolve onto it, and its background
 * policy declaration. Both the router and the background resolver in `App.tsx`
 * derive from it, so adding/renaming a builtin surface is a one-line data edit
 * that both consumers pick up — no second list to keep in sync.
 *
 * The React render functions themselves stay co-located in `App.tsx` (they
 * close over many local view components), but they are keyed off the canonical
 * ids declared here, and alias resolution is owned here too.

/**
 * How a builtin tab declares its surface manifest across its routes.
 *
 *  - A single {@link SurfaceManifest} — one manifest for every route under the
 *    tab (e.g. chat/background always paint the shared wallpaper).
 *  - `{ shared: (path) => boolean }` — the tab paints the shared wallpaper only
 *    when the live navigation path satisfies the predicate (e.g. the launcher
 *    root of a tab that owns opaque sub-routes), otherwise it falls through to
 *    the caller's downstream resolution. Matches the two path-conditional
 *    surfaces (`views`, `apps`) whose launcher root is immersive but whose
 *    sub-routes are opaque.
 *
 * Either form is resolved through the grant-gated {@link resolveSurfaceManifest}
 * so a builtin tab paints the wallpaper only when its manifest explicitly grants
 * `wallpaper` — the same accidental-opt-in guard the per-view manifest enforces
 * (#13452). A tab with no `surface` field declares no builtin-level policy and
 * falls through to the caller's downstream resolution (registered views etc.).
