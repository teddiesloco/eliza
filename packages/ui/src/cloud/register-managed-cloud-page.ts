/**
 * Registers the unified Cloud management route family as one lazy page in the

 * the web router separately redirects retired `/dashboard/*` bookmarks into
 * it. The page owns a nested React Router route family, so its surface manifest
 * grants navigation while leaving storage and wallpaper authority
