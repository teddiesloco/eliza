/**
 * One-time first-session hint that teaches the home ↔ launcher swipe (#13453
 * design-verdict debt #5). The rail's page dots were removed (they collided
 * with the floating composer) and on touch devices the horizontal swipe is the
 * sole rail navigation, so a brand-new user has no signal the launcher exists.
 * This floating pill surfaces once — after a short settle delay in the user's
 * first session on the home half — then retires forever through the
 * home-dismissal sunset lifecycle: it counts one `seen` session when it
 * actually paints (`afterSeen: 1` retires it from the next session on),
 * retires on `acted` the moment the user first flips the rail to the launcher
 * (they demonstrably know the gesture — including before the hint ever shows),
 * and dismisses itself permanently after one full display cycle.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT persistent chrome: `pointer-events-none` + `aria-hidden`,
 * so it can never intercept the gesture it teaches, and it never renders on
 * fine-pointer/hover devices — {@link PagerEdgeButtons} is their resting
 * affordance (exact media-query complement, no gap and no overlap).
