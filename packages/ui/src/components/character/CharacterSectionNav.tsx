/**
 * The Character family header: a centered "Character" `ViewHeader` (icon-only
 * launcher back) ABOVE a secondary section-tab strip that ties the four sibling
 * Character views into one group — Personality, Relationships, Skills,
 * Experience (#13591 / views-redesign epic #13560).
 *
 * Unlike Wallet's `SectionNav`, whose members are plugin-contributed app-shell
 * pages that join/leave at runtime, the Character family is a fixed host-owned
 * set, so the tabs are a static declaration fed to the shared presentational
 * `SectionTabStrip`. That keeps the doctrine geometry + ghost-tab styling
 * identical to Wallet/Settings while avoiding a registry round-trip (and the
 * route-hijack that registering these built-in routes as app-shell pages would
 * cause — their render path stays the App.tsx static-tab renderers).
 *
 * Knowledge is deliberately NOT a member: per epic #13560 doctrine it is a
 * standalone multimedia peer hub (#13594 folds Transcripts + Files into it),
 * reachable from the launcher, not owned as a Character sub-tab. It keeps its
 * own "Knowledge" header rather than rendering under this "Character" one.
