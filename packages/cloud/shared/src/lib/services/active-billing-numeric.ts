/**
 * Numeric parsing boundary for active-billing display + credit-ledger rows.
 *
 * Postgres NUMERIC fields (`containers.total_billed`, `agent_sandboxes.total_billed`,
 * `agent_sandboxes.hourly_rate`, `credit_transactions.amount`) arrive from the driver
 * as strings. A corrupt value — a `'NaN'::numeric` (which Postgres accepts and reads
 * back as the string `"NaN"`), a driver quirk, a migration artifact, or a manual DB
 * edit — must throw here instead of silently coercing to `NaN` via a bare `Number(...)`.
 *
 * These values are read into user-facing surfaces:
 *
 *   - `listActiveResources()` → `totalBilled` / `hourlyRate` render the amount already
 *     billed for a live resource in the billing panel. A `NaN` becomes a fabricated
 *     "$NaN billed" line that looks like a real (broken) charge.
 *   - `listLedger()` → `amount` is the credit-transaction ledger a user reads to
 *     RECONCILE real charges. A `NaN` amount silently corrupts their reconciliation
 *     view — the one place they audit what they were charged.
 *
 * Failing closed surfaces the corruption (clean 500 at the route boundary via the
 * existing try/catch → `failureResponse`) instead of shipping a fabricated `NaN`
 * into the billing display or the credit-reconciliation ledger. `0` is a
 * legitimate domain value (default `"0.00"`) and is preserved; callers add
 * non-negative bounds for accumulated resource totals and rates.
