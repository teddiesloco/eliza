/**
 * Canonical earnings-unit contract (#22960).
 *
 * UNIT CANON: redeemable earnings are stored, ledgered, converted to credits,
 * and redeemed in **US dollars** as `NUMERIC(18,4)` / `Decimal` (4 decimal
 * places). "Points" are a **redemption HTTP-boundary representation only**:
 * the public API accepts integer `pointsAmount` where
 * `REDEMPTION_POINTS_PER_USD = 100` (one point = $0.01). No service,
 * repository, job, or ledger may interpret a stored earnings value as
 * anything other than USD.
 *
 * Conversion boundary (server-side single source of truth): all SERVER-side
 * code converts points<->USD exclusively through this module — no inline
 * ratio recomputation in cloud services or API routes. (The browser UI keeps
 * its own string-input parser in `redemption-client-contract.ts`, which is
 * deliberately dependency-free for the browser bundle; it pins the same
 * 100:1 ratio and is covered by its own contract tests.)
 * - points -> USD: `usdFromPoints(points)` = points / 100, exact for integer
 *   points (Decimal division, no float).
 * - USD -> points: `pointsFromUsd(usd)` = usd * 100. Integer USD produces
 *   integer points; sub-cent USD (more than 2 decimals) is rejected because
 *   the API boundary accepts only integer points.
 *
 * Rounding policy: there is none at this boundary — the ratio is an exact
 * 100:1 integer ratio. Any rounding of earnings to 4dp happens where earnings
 * are CREDITED (see the container-billing / markup services), not here.
