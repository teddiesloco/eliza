/**
 * Durable conversation history for Tier-0 "shared" agents (which run in-Worker
 * with no container, so they have no per-agent database of their own).
 *
 * Previously this history lived ONLY in the request cache, which is disabled on
 * the prod Worker (`CACHE_ENABLED=false`, no KV backend) — so `cache.set` was a
 * silent no-op, history never persisted, and the agent had no cross-turn memory
 * (and `GET .../messages` always returned `[]`). This table makes it durable in
 * the same Postgres the Worker already uses, independent of any cache config.
 *
 * One row per `(agent_id, channel_id)` holds the capped, ordered message list,
 * merged by stable message id each turn. Kept deliberately isolated from the encrypted/billed
 * `conversations`/`conversation_messages` tables (the chat-completions product)
 * so the lightweight shared tier stays decoupled, as designed.
