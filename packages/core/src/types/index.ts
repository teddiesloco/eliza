/**
 * Canonical barrel for the core type system: re-exports every `types/*` module
 * plus the public prompt/util helpers, forming the `@elizaos/core` type surface
 * that `@elizaos/agent`, `@elizaos/app-core`, and every plugin import.
 *
 * Most modules are re-exported via `export *`, but a few whose runtime values
 * must survive tree-shaking (e.g. view-kind) are re-exported explicitly — see
 * the inline note before converting one back to a star export.
