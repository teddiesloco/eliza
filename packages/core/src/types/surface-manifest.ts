/**
 * Surface manifests — the single declared contract that governs how the app
 * shell isolates one view from every other surface. A view renders into a
 * shared shell tree, so without a declared boundary a view can visually or
 * behaviourally leak into the rest of the app (paint the launcher wallpaper
 * onto an opaque page, keep a global background channel live, reach past the
 * shell into another view's DOM). The manifest makes that boundary explicit and
 * data-driven: background policy, header framing, isolation level, lifecycle
 * expectation, and the capability grants a view is allowed to exercise all live
 * in ONE typed structure hung off the view registration.
 *
 * The manifest is the source of truth every consumer derives from — the shell's
 * background resolver reads {@link SurfaceManifest.background}, the capability
 * broker reads {@link SurfaceManifest.capabilities}, and the isolation doc names
 * each {@link SurfaceIsolationLevel}. A view never opts into the wallpaper by
 * accident: {@link resolveSurfaceManifest} only honours `background: "shared"`
 * when the manifest also grants the `wallpaper` capability, so the launcher and
 * views that explicitly declare immersion are the only surfaces that can paint
 * it (issue #13452 acceptance: "Shared app wallpaper is restricted to
 * Home/Launcher/Background and explicitly marked immersive views ... no view can
 * opt in by accident").
 *
 * Lives in `@elizaos/core` so the agent server (view registry, /api/views) and
 * every front-end (dashboard shell, view manager, DynamicViewLoader capability
 * broker) share one definition — the same reason {@link ViewKind} lives here.
 * Consumers: `packages/ui/src/App.tsx` (background resolver),
 * `packages/ui/src/components/views/DynamicViewLoader.tsx` (capability broker),
 * `packages/ui/src/surface-isolation.ts` (isolation-level catalogue + doc).

/**
 * How a view is separated from the host realm and from other views. Ordered

 * uses and why, and maps each level to its per-platform embedding
 * (Electron `WebContentsView`, sandboxed `<iframe>`, `WKWebView`/Android
 * `WebView`).
 *
 *  - `in-process`      — trusted built-in shell views run in the host DOM/React
 *                        realm with the full host singleton (React, API client,
 *                        native bridges). No sandbox; trust is the boundary.
 *  - `sandboxed-iframe` — untrusted/plugin web views run in a sandboxed iframe
 *                        with a postMessage capability broker. Never combine
 *                        `allow-scripts` + `allow-same-origin` on same-origin
 *                        content — that is not a real sandbox (MDN).
 *  - `native-webview`  — heavy/untrusted views embed a native child web-content
 *                        surface (desktop `WebContentsView`, iOS `WKWebView`,
 *                        Android `WebView`) with its own renderer process and an
 *                        explicit process/storage-sharing policy.
 *  - `immersive`       — a fullscreen surface that owns its whole window
 *                        (launcher, background editor). Chrome-free and the only
 *                        non-launcher level allowed to paint the shared
 *                        wallpaper, and only when it also grants `wallpaper`.
