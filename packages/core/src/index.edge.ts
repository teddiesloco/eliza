/**
 * Cloudflare Workers entry point for the Eliza runtime and plugin contracts.
 *
 * Workers run this surface with `nodejs_compat`, which supplies the supported
 * Node APIs used by core while preserving Web Platform request and storage
 * boundaries. Host-only provisioning and plugin discovery stay outside this
 * entry; durable product state must still live in an injected database adapter,
 * Durable Object, or external service rather than the request-local filesystem.
