# Contributing

Contribute through issues, project boards, discussions, and pull requests against
`develop`. The repository is agent-operated as well as human-maintained, so the
useful record is the one a reviewer can inspect later: scoped work, current
board state, linked code, and evidence that the real behavior happened.

## Start Work

Open an issue before non-trivial work. The issue owns the scope, acceptance
criteria, blockers, and evidence plan. Use the existing issue templates when
they fit:

- [Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
- [Feature Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
- [Agent Work Item](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/agent_work_item.md)

Branch from the latest `develop` with `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`,
`docs/<slug>`, or `chore/<slug>`. Always sync before opening or updating a PR:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/develop
bun install
bun run verify
```

Keep package-local instructions in view. Read root `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`,
then the package-local `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` before touching that package.

### Reuse-first implementation gate

Before creating a component, hook, utility, type, service, schema, protocol
adapter, or test harness, search the owning package, its public exports, and
the full repository for an existing implementation and its callers. Check
dynamic imports, plugin manifests, registries, generated inventories, stories,
and package subpaths before concluding that a surface is missing or unused.

- Extend or compose the canonical owner when the semantics match. UI primitives,
  layouts, loading/error states, and design tokens belong in `@elizaos/ui`;
  plugin packages should keep domain composition while consuming that shared
  foundation.
- Put framework contracts in `@elizaos/core`, cross-product utilities and wire
  contracts in `@elizaos/shared`, and domain behavior in its owning package.
  Do not copy a contract or helper merely to avoid fixing an import boundary.
- When similar code must remain separate, document the semantic or runtime
  difference that prevents consolidation. Superficial name or shape similarity
  alone is not a reason to merge unrelated domains.
- When replacing duplication, migrate callers and tests to one authority and
  remove the obsolete implementation. Preserve public compatibility through a
  deliberate re-export or deprecation path rather than a second maintained copy.

The issue or pull request should record the searches performed, the selected
owner, and why reuse, extension, extraction, or intentional separation is the
correct outcome.

## Issue and test quality gate

Do not open an issue or pull request merely because a file, export, branch, or
line is uncovered. Coverage is a diagnostic signal, not a product requirement.
An issue must identify a concrete defect, regression, risk, or missing
consumer-visible capability, name the affected caller or boundary, and define
an observable acceptance result. Do not create speculative per-file,
per-package, or inventory-only audit issues whose acceptable outcome is “no
change.” Run the audit first and open a narrowly scoped issue only for a real
finding.

A test-only pull request must protect meaningful behavior or a documented
external contract. It must explain what realistic regression the test detects,
which consumer would observe it, and why an existing higher-level test does not
already own the contract. A red result after mutating the asserted literal is
not by itself evidence that the test is valuable.

Do not add tests whose material assertions only:

- copy constants, names, labels, copy text, URLs, CSS classes, visual tokens,
  array lengths, object keys, or other implementation literals;
- check that an export, type-shaped object, class, function, property, file,
  asset, generated catalog entry, barrel re-export, or fixture exists;
- inspect schema or metadata descriptors without exercising the database,
  parser, transport, migration, or consumer behavior they are meant to drive;
- prove TypeScript assignability at runtime, restate the implementation in the
  test, snapshot deterministic fixture data, or assert a mock that substitutes
  for the system under test; or
- increase line, branch, or module coverage without a concrete behavioral
  regression contract.

These checks create change-detector noise: an intentional implementation edit
requires changing the test in lockstep while no user-visible failure is
prevented. They should be removed or replaced with a test at the owning
behavioral boundary. Narrow exceptions exist for externally versioned wire
values, security allowlists, migration contracts, and generated-artifact
integrity, but the test must exercise or validate that external boundary rather
than simply mirror its source declaration.

## GitHub Projects

Issues are work cards. GitHub Projects are the live kanban state and ownership
record. Use fields already present on the active board before adding new ones.

Standard flow:

1. `Todo`: ready and unclaimed.
2. `Claimed`: an owner has committed to the card.
3. `In progress`: code, config, deployment, or shared state is actively being
   changed.
4. `Needs-agent-verify`: evidence is posted and another agent should check it.
5. `needs-human-verify`: agent verification is done or not applicable; a human
   needs to approve or test.
6. `Done`: only the managing human or maintainer moves cards here unless the
   board explicitly says otherwise.

When claiming a card, comment `CLAIMING: <scope>` on the issue, set the Project
`Claimed by` field to your lane or agent tag, and keep `Status` accurate. If the
work needs a shared lever such as production deploys, staging environments, DNS,
secrets, billing, or rollback authority, comment `CLAIMING LEVER: <thing>`
before touching it and release the lever when done.

Use Discussions for coordination, handoffs, multi-card questions, and noisy
status. Do not make a Discussion the only acceptance record for a task. Durable
decisions belong back in issue bodies, project readmes, `AGENTS.md`, or package
docs.

## Pull Requests

Every change ships through a PR against `develop`; do not push feature or fix
work straight to `develop`. Link the issue or Project card the PR resolves.
Keep PRs scoped to one coherent change. If a sweeping mechanical edit touches
many packages, explain why it is mechanical and keep package-specific behavior
changes out of the same PR.

The branch must be rebased on `origin/develop` before review. Resolve every
conflict, run the relevant package checks, and run `bun run verify` when the
change is ready for full validation.

### Maintainer CI exception

A maintainer explicitly named as a bypass actor by the live repository ruleset
may merge an exact pull request head while the canonical required hosted check
is queued or failing only when the check is unavailable for infrastructure
reasons or its failure is proven unrelated to the pull request diff. Repository
write or administration access alone is not bypass authorization. The reviewed
ruleset manifest currently grants no bypass actors, so this exception remains
documentary unless a separate reviewed ruleset change and live readback grant
that authority. A passing check on an older head, an unexplained failure, a
flaky retry, or an assertion that the change is low risk is not sufficient.

Before using the exception, the maintainer must record in the pull request:

- the exact 40-character pull request head SHA and the `origin/develop` SHA
  used for validation;
- a live ruleset readback naming the bypass authorizer as an eligible actor;
- every queued or failing check, its run URL, and concrete evidence that the
  condition is infrastructure-only or unrelated;
- exact-head results for all tests, typechecks, lint, builds, security scans,
  and real-behavior evidence applicable to the changed surface, including
  commands, exit status, and artifact links;
- an independent approving reviewer, and explicit bypass authorization from a
  maintainer other than the pull request author; and
- the merge method, rollback owner, and any post-merge validation that must run
  on `develop`.

The exception is invalid as soon as the pull request head or validated
`origin/develop` changes, the pull request is no longer conflict-free, or an
affected-path check reports a substantive failure. It never waives failed
affected tests, unresolved conflicts, missing applicable evidence, or the
second-lane rules for money, schema, deploy, credentials, and other protected
levers. Applicable security and secret scans, plus release/build provenance and
source-SHA attestations, must complete successfully for the exact head; they
cannot be classified away as unrelated or left queued under this exception. If
a full repository command fails outside the affected surface, the record must
include a clean reproduction on `origin/develop` at the documented base SHA and
the narrower exact-head commands that prove the changed contract. Immediately
before merging, the authorizer must re-read the remote head, current
`origin/develop`, mergeability, approval, and exception record. A pull request
that changes this exception may not rely on the new wording for its own merge.

After an exception merge, the author or designated rollback owner must inspect
the resulting `develop` run. A substantive regression attributable to the
merge requires immediate revert or repair; queued or infrastructure-only
post-merge checks remain documented until resolved.

This creates an auditable maintainer exception; it does not change GitHub
rulesets or grant bypass permission.

## Contribution Provenance

Provider, model, and agent-tooling disclosure is optional. Contributors must
not be blocked, prompted, or asked to reveal runtime metadata in order to open
an issue, comment, review, or pull request. When a contributor voluntarily
includes machine provenance, use the following interoperable footer:

```text
AI provider/model: <provider> / <exact-model-id>
Client / agent tooling: <client>
Contribution skill revision: elizaOS/eliza@<full-commit-sha>:packages/skills/skills/contribute-to-eliza
Attribution status: self-reported
— [<lane-tag>]
<!-- eliza-computer-attribution:v1 {"provider":"<provider-slug>","model":"<exact-model-id>","client":"<client>","skill_revision":"elizaOS/eliza@<full-commit-sha>:packages/skills/skills/contribute-to-eliza"} -->
```

Voluntary attribution is self-reported provenance, not a verified attestation
or a request for chain-of-thought. If supplied, it must be concrete,
internally consistent, and free of hidden reasoning, private prompts, session
IDs, credentials, access tokens, and other secrets. Repository validators
accept contributions with no attribution and validate only an attribution
block that an author chooses to provide.

## Evidence

A reviewer must be able to confirm the real behavior without reading the code.
Attach complete, manually reviewed evidence inline in the issue or PR. Do not
commit evidence artifacts to the repository.

Required evidence by surface:

- UI changes: before and after full-page screenshots for desktop and mobile, an
  MP4 walkthrough of the full flow, frontend console and network logs, and
  backend logs when a server path fires.
- Agent, model, prompt, provider, or action changes: real live-model
  trajectories with inputs, outputs, tool calls, and results.
- Native, mobile, desktop, or device changes: per-platform screenshots,
  recordings, logs, and proof the installed build is current.
- Domain changes: the artifacts produced by the change, such as DB rows,
  memories, scheduled tasks, generated files, wallet balances, on-chain
  transaction hashes, audio, or device output.

If an evidence type does not apply, keep it visible in the PR and write
`N/A - <reason>`. Never leave evidence rows blank. Open every artifact yourself
before asking for review; capturing is not review.

Evidence is a reviewer-owned acceptance record rather than a required GitHub
Actions status. Use `scripts/check-pr-evidence.mjs` locally when preparing the
pull request, and reject missing or placeholder evidence during review. A PR
whose diff touches rendered UI should attach concrete before/after screenshots,
a walkthrough video, and OCR review artifacts.

**Before capturing, check your toolchain.** Run the doctor; it reports every
capture tool (tesseract, ffmpeg, Playwright browsers, GPU/Baidu OCR, Apple
Vision, VLM API keys, the claude/codex CLIs) and prints the exact install/start
command for anything missing. Install what it flags — a missing tool is a
fixable instruction, never a reason to ship without evidence.

### Install or repair the capture toolchain

From the repository root, one command installs or repairs the required
cross-platform capture dependencies and verifies their executable behavior:

```bash
bun run evidence:install-tools
```

The installer supports macOS with Homebrew, Windows with WinGet, and Linux with
apt-get, dnf, yum, apk, pacman, or zypper. It prefers healthy system or packaged
ffmpeg/ffprobe binaries instead of installing a redundant system copy, installs
the repository-pinned Playwright Chromium, and runs the strict doctor before it
returns success. Dependency bootstrap is locked and uses `--ignore-scripts`, so
it does not run unrelated repository postinstall or artifact-sync hooks.

Use `--github` to also install and execute the optional GitHub CLI; this does
not authenticate, persist credentials, change repository permissions, or prove
that a token can upload evidence. Use `--skip-deps` only when the locked
workspace dependencies are already installed. `--dry-run` prints the exact
argument-safe commands of the one resolved plan execution also consumes —
including the trailing strict doctor verification — without changing the host;
lines beginning `# assumes:` note where resolution depends on the dependency
step having run (packaged media binaries only resolve after `bun install`).
Add `--strict` to a dry run to fail when such assumptions remain. Every step
carries a deadline (15 minutes for package-manager operations, 2 minutes for
probes, 10 minutes for the doctor) so a wedged package manager or download
cannot block forever; multiply all deadlines on slow hosts with
`--timeout-scale=<factor>` or `ELIZA_EVIDENCE_INSTALL_TIMEOUT_SCALE`.

```bash
bun run evidence:install-tools -- --github
bun run evidence:install-tools -- --skip-deps
bun run evidence:install-tools -- --dry-run
bun run evidence:install-tools -- --dry-run --strict
bun run evidence:install-tools -- --timeout-scale=3
```

Package downloads, Playwright browser installation, and package-manager index
updates require network access. Linux system packages use root directly or
require a successful `sudo -n` preflight; the installer never prompts for a
password. Homebrew runs as the current user, while WinGet uses silent,
non-interactive agreement flags. A missing Homebrew, WinGet, or supported Linux
package manager is an explicit failure. Windows PATH refresh is local to the
installer process, and no supported platform path edits shell profiles or
developer configuration. Missing optional accelerators remain explicit
non-blocking doctor findings; missing required OCR, media, or browser
capabilities fail the strict doctor.

```bash
bun run evidence:doctor                   # human capability report
bun run evidence:doctor -- --strict       # fail if a required tool is missing
bun run evidence:doctor -- --strict --json  # normalized CI/operator report
```

**Visual verification is layered and always available.** OCR runs the GPU/Baidu
Unlimited-OCR engine when a vision server is up and falls back to tesseract
otherwise; heuristic checks add flat-color/palette and pixel-diff comparisons;
and structured VLM Q&A (`vision-qa`) reviews screenshots against explicit
questions. When no API key or local server is configured, set
`ELIZA_VISION_QA_BACKEND=cli` to review screenshots through an already-authed
`claude` or `codex` CLI (auto-detected by the doctor) — real token usage is
recorded, so the review is admissible evidence.

Useful commands:

```bash
# Real-LLM agent trajectories
packages/scenario-runner/bin/eliza-scenarios run <scenario.ts> --report <out.json>

# E2E UI recordings
bun run test:e2e:record:review

# Full matrix review bundle
bun run test:matrix:review

# Re-open the newest verified bundle, or name the exact run explicitly
bun run evidence:review:no-open
bun run evidence:review:no-open -- --bundle=evidence/runs/<run-id>

# App + cloud-UI screenshots; required for packages/app UI changes
bun run --cwd packages/app audit:app

# Native per-platform capture when a native/mobile/desktop surface changes
bun run --cwd packages/app capture:ios-sim -- --issue <n> --slug <s>
bun run --cwd packages/app capture:android-emu -- --issue <n> --slug <s>
bun run --cwd packages/app capture:linux-desktop -- --issue <n> --slug <s>
bun run --cwd packages/app capture:windows-desktop -- --issue <n> --slug <s>
```

The matrix command snapshots producer hashes and filesystem identity before
executing lanes, creates one named bundle from only new or written/replaced
artifacts, runs the canonical
integrity verifier, and passes that exact run to the dashboard. Raw producer directories
are never scanned implicitly; `evidence:review -- --source=<dir>` is reserved
for deliberate archived or ad-hoc compatibility review.

Post videos as MP4 so GitHub renders them inline, screenshots as JPG where
possible, and long logs in a `<details>` block. Re-capture evidence after
rebasing when `develop` changes the behavior under review.

**Headless agents (no browser, cannot drag-and-drop):** upload media to the
dedicated [`pr-evidence` release](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/releases/tag/pr-evidence)
and embed the asset URLs — they end in a media extension and render inline via
`![](…)`. Prefer the one-command tool, which also patches the PR rows and
validates them locally:

```bash
# name files <pr-number>-<artifact>.<ext>, then:
node scripts/pr-evidence.mjs attach 15171 15171-after-desktop.jpg 15171-walkthrough.mp4
# embed in the PR evidence rows:
#   ![after](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/releases/download/pr-evidence/15171-after-desktop.jpg)
```

GitHub caps a release at 1000 assets, so once `pr-evidence` fills, `attach`
rolls uploads into overflow releases (`pr-evidence-2`, `pr-evidence-3`, …) and
emits the URL of whichever release holds the asset. The gate accepts the whole
`pr-evidence`/`pr-evidence-N` family identically, so no manual tag juggling is
needed — always attach via the script rather than a raw `gh release upload`,
which fails once the target release is full.

Never delete assets referenced by an open PR. A worked example of a fully
evidenced PR (before/after screenshots, MP4 walkthroughs, OCR readout,
vision-QA trajectory with the model named, pixel-diff report, zero-error
frontend logs) is [#15171](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/15171).

## Security Reporting

The canonical security policy — reporting channels, disclosure window, and
remediation SLAs — is [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). In short: report
vulnerabilities privately through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/security/advisories/new)
or `security@elizalabs.ai`; do not open a public GitHub issue for a live
vulnerability, credential leak, exploit path, or embargoed dependency issue.
Include affected versions or commits, reproduction steps, impact, and any safe
proof of exploitability. Contributors who encounter a secret or suspected
vulnerability must stop exposing details publicly and route the finding through
those private channels.

Security architecture and hardening notes live in
[`packages/docs/security.md`](packages/docs/security.md). SOC2 and
incident-response reference material lives under
[`packages/docs/security/`](packages/docs/security/). Package-specific security
implementation notes live in the relevant package docs.
